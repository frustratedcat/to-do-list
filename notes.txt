- Create to-do objects as factory functions to take the following arguments:
  - title
  - description
  - due date 
  - priority
  - notes
  - checklist
    - To-dos should be categorized in the following order: due date, priority, title alphabetical order

- Create project arrays to contain each associated to-do:
  - There should be a default project
  - Logic needs to check if a project exists before creating a to-do
  - User should be able to add or delete projects and associated to-dos
  - User should be able to move to-dos to different projects

- Create user dashboard where user can: 
  - view all projects
  - view all to-dos in each project:
    - Title, priority, due date are all that need to be shown in the basic view. User can click on them for expanded view.
  - expand each to-do to see description and notes
  - modify to-do 
  - delete to-do

- Create a calendar that shows weekly, monthly, and yearly with a button for each, and add to-dos with dates on them accordingly
  - use date-fns from webpack for manipulating dates

- Use web storage API for saving to local storage
  - Save to local storage every time a project or to-do is created, deleted, or modified
  - Make sure app doesn't crash if storage file isn't there or has been deleted
    - You'll need to learn about local storage and JSON to do all of this stuff

- Logic should be separate from DOM-related functionality

- DOM stuff
  - You can maybe model this after your bullet journal
